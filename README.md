Deploying SharpShell Servers
----------------------------

There is an article on the CodeProject that describes in detail how you can use the Server Registration Manager tool 
to deploy SharpShell servers:

[Deploying SharpShell Servers](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/653780/NET-Shell-Extensions-Deploying-SharpShell-Servers)

## Supported Shell Extensions

The following extensions are supported by SharpShell.

### Shell Context Menus

Shell Context Menus allow the context menus used in Windows Explorer to be customised.

### Icon Handlers

Shell Icon Handlers are DLLs that are registered in the system to customise the appearance of icons.

### Info Tip Handlers

Shell Info Tip Handlers are DLLs that are registered in the system to customise tooltips for items in the shell.

### Drop Handlers

Shell Drop  Handlers are DLLs that are registered in the system to extend the drag and drop functionality in the Shell.

### Preview Handlers

Shell PreviewHandlers are dlls that can be registered in the system to allow you to create visually rich previews for items that are displayed directly in Windows Explorer.

[Step by Step Tutorial on the CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/533948/NET-Shell-Extensions-Shell-Preview-Handlers).

### Icon Overlay Handlers

Shell Icon Overlay Handlers can be really useful. They let you display an icon overlay over shell objects to provide extra information. Programs like Dropbox use these overlays to show whether icons are synchronised or not.

### Thumbnail Handlers

Shell Thumbnail Handlers (or as they're sometimes known, Shell Thumbnail Providers) are COM servers that you can write to customise the appearance of the thumbnail icons in the Windows Shell.

[Step by Step Tutorial on the CodeProject](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/563114/NET-Shell-Extensions-Shell-Thumbnail-Handlers).

### Property Sheet Extensions

These are extensions that add extra pages to the property sheets shown for shell items such as files, network shares, folders and so on.

### DeskBand Extensions

Useful notes:

* Always include a DisplayName for a deskband extension, otherwise it won't register.
* The UserControl for deskband should specify a minimum size and maximum size - if they're
  not specified the actual size will be used.

Testimonials
------------

If you've used SharpShell and would like to add a testimonial, just send me a message!

> CmisSync, our Dropbox-like client for Enterprise Content Management servers, just switched to SharpShell, 
> and we are extremely pleased with this library. Our previous custom-built Windows Explorer integration 
> was buggy, unreliable and hard to maintain, and SharpShell is really rock-solid in comparison. The best 
> part: It only took 2 days to integrate SharpShell into our software, testing and installer included. 
> Thanks SharpShell!
